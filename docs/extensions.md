# CLI eXtensions

A CLI eXtension is a [plugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_%28computing%29){target=_blank} that adds new commands
to Artisan Enterprise for a specific purpose.

For example, __k__ is an extension that adds Kubernetes management commands to the Artisan CLI.

## Automated deployment

Extensions are installed automatically by Artisan when you issue a command that uses it.

For example, imagine you want to access Kubernetes management functions
